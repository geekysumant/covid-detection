A deep learning model based on CNN fro detecting and mapping covid affected chest x-rays images
So, this model is primarily focussed upon detecting Covid-19 using chest x-ray images. The dataset comprised of around 280 images containing equal no. of normal x-rays and covid affected chest x-rays. The no. of images are low because of the reason that x-ray images of covid affected patients are very low in number on the internet. So to overcome this, data augmentation has been done to increase and generalise what the model sees on the available no. of images.
